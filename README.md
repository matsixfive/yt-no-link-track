# Stop tracking links on YouTube

This [userscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) automatically redirects links in youtube descriptions away from youtube's tracking servers which inhibits them from tracking what links you are visiting as well as speeding up the load times of the websited that are linked to.

## How to install

The most popular userscript manager is [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) but others are avaliable. Create a new script for `https://www.youtube.com/watch*` and paste in the code from `index.js`.
